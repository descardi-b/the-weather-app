🌸 hey there! 🌸 <br />

welcome to the weather app, a quick way to get the forecast for the days ahead. <br />

in this challenge, i was tasked with: <br />

🍓 calling, pulling, and displaying weather data from the open weather map api <br />
🍓 dynamically creating a five-day weather forecast tab <br />
🍓 creating a method to save and get previously searched cities from local storage <br />

here are some screenshots of my work:
